# quickMap
Drag and drop a simple image to convert pixels into rectangles and dump into a lua table. Separation by color optional

Instructions are in the utility. Note: this is definitely not designed as a library or module to be included in your game directly. It's meant so you can just open up mspaint, draw some squiggles, and optimize it into rectangles for quick and easy collision. Best used as a supplement for other mapping stuff.
